# NetflixVisualization
This project is part of my Matplotlib learning journey. I used the Netflix Movies &amp; TV Shows dataset (CSV) to explore and visualize different aspects of Netflixâ€™s content library. The goal is to practice data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Pandas + Matplotlib.
