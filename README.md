📊 Netflix Data Analysis with Matplotlib

This project is part of my Matplotlib learning journey. I used the Netflix Movies & TV Shows dataset (CSV) to explore and visualize different aspects of Netflix’s content library. The goal is to practice data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Pandas + Matplotlib.

🔎 Project Overview

Netflix has thousands of movies and TV shows released worldwide. In this project, I cleaned the dataset and created visualizations to answer some interesting questions such as:

How many movies vs TV shows are available?

What are the most common content ratings?

How has Netflix content grown over the years?

Which countries have the highest number of releases?

Which countries contribute most movies vs TV shows?
